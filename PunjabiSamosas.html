    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> 5 medium potatoes (yellow or red, boiled until tender and coarsely chopped)</li>
        <li> ½ cup peas (frozen peas work best here. If using fresh, cook the peas until tender before using)</li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>

            <li> Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for deep frying </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Dough Wrapper</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mix the flour, carom seeds, oil and salt in a large bowl or in a stand mixer.</li>
        <li> Add water, half a cup at first and then a tablespoon at a time, and knead until you have a very stiff dough. You want to be very sure your dough is very stiff and not soft. </li>
        <li>Cover the dough and set aside while you make the filling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Peas Potato Filling</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crumble the potatoes with your fingers so you have a few lumps. </li>
        <li>Heat the oil. </li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds and, as they start to brown, add the ginger. </li>
        <li>Saute the ginger for 30 seconds, the add the coriander leaves and the green chili pepper. Saute for a few seconds. </li>
        <li>Add the coriander powder, turmeric, pomegranate seed powder and chaat masala. Stir to mix. </li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and mix well. </li>
        <li>Add the peas and stir-fry until the peas are tender and the mixture is very dry, about two to three more minutes. </li>
        <li>Add salt to taste. Turn off the heat and let the filling cool slightly. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Make the Samosas</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Divide the dough into 7 equal balls.
            <li>Roll out each ball into an oval, about six inches long and four inches wide. </li>
            <li>Using a pizza cutter, cut across the long side of the oval to create two semicircular pieces.</li>
            <li>Coat the edges of each semicircle with water.</li>
            <li>Pick the two corners of the semicircle and bring them together, edges overlapping slightly, to form a cone. Press down on the seam to stick it. </li>
            It's important to do this thoroughly because you don't want your samosas to open while you're frying them.
            <li>Inside the cone, place a few teaspoons of the filling.</li>
            <li>Now seal the top of the samosa by pressing the top seam together and back.</li>
            <li>Repeat for remaining samosas.</li>
            <li>In a frying pan, heat three inches of oil.</li>
            <li>When the oil reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit, drop the samosas, one at a time.</li>
            <li>Fry the samosas, turning over occasionally, until they are golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels before serving.</li>
    </ul>
