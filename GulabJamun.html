    <p>
        Gulab Jamun is a classic Pakistani dessert and is made of milk solids which are deep fried and then immersed in a sugar syrup.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Gulab Jamun Ingredients</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup full-fat milk powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee (You can find ghee at the store)</li>
        <li>5 to 6 tablespoons milk, as needed</li>
        <li>Oil for deep-frying</li>

    </ul>
        
    <p>
        <strong>Sugar Syrup Ingredients</strong>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1-1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 green cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon rose essence (If using rose water, use 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons.)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon juice (This prevents the sugar syrup from crystallizing.)</li>

    </ul>
    
    <strong>Directions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li> Prepare the dough. In a mixing bowl, add the milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder and ghee.</li>
        Slowly add the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and gently form the dough by mixing. </li>
        <li>It should be a stiff dough. If the dough is sticky, grease your palms with oil and gently mix. Do not knead the dough—it will make the jamuns hard.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest. Cover the dough with a damp cloth. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sugar syrup, In a saucepan, add the sugar, water and two green cardamom pods, crushed.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and let the sugar dissolve. When the sugar is completely dissolved, simmer over medium-low heat for 5 to 6 minutes. </li>
            We need a sticky-consistency sugar syrup here. </li>
        <li>When it’s ready, remove the syrup from the heat and add the rose essence or rose water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll the jamuns. Grease your palms and pinch a small amount of dough. Roll gently to form a small, smooth small ball.</li>
        <li>Fry the jamuns. In a heavy saucepan, heat a few inches of oil over low heat.The oil should not be very hot while frying the gulab jamuns. </li>
        <li>Slowly drop in 4 to 5 balls, depending on the pan size, and deep-fry the jamuns until they turn golden brown. </li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, keep rotating them in the oil for even cooking and coloring. It takes me 4 to 5 minutes for each batch. </li>
        <li>When the jamuns are golden brown, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Add jamuns to the sugar syrup. Let each jamun sit for 45 to 60 seconds, and then add the fried jamuns to the warm sugar syrup.</li>
            Let the jamuns soak in the sugar syrup for at least 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Garnish with almond slices and serve! There you have it, heaven on earth!!!!!</li>
    </ol>
